<p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk">Codefirst Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>
<ol>
<li>HTML is cool
<li>CSS is cooler
<li>JS is the best
</ol>
<h3><i>What do you need to create a website?</i></h3>
Not much!
<ol>
  <li>A computer (always a good start)
  <li>A text editor (I am using atom)
  <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)
  <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files
</ol>
